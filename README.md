# Image-Classification-Model-with-NasNet-Large

This GitHub repository contains code for an image classification model trained using NASNetLarge architecture. The model is designed to classify images into one of four classes: "Blasto," "Positives," "Negatives," and "Background." Please note that the dataset used for training is confidential and cannot be shared.



Model Overview
Model Architecture: The model employs the NASNetLarge architecture, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on a large dataset.
Image Preprocessing: Image data is preprocessed using various techniques, including data augmentation (horizontal flip, vertical flip, rotation, shear) and rescaling to ensure optimal training.
Transfer Learning: Transfer learning is utilized by taking advantage of the NASNetLarge's pre-trained weights. Only the top layers of the model are fine-tuned for the specific classification task.
Training: The model is trained using the confidential dataset with four distinct classes.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated based on training and testing accuracy.
Usage
Due to the confidentiality of the dataset, the actual data and weights of the trained model are not included in this repository. However, you can use the provided code as a reference for training your own image classification model with a similar architecture.



To train your model, make sure to replace the dataset and adapt the code to your specific requirements. You can also modify the hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs, to fine-tune the training process.
